## Installation and setup

This code requires the installation of python 3.11.5 or later, 
python setup instructions can be found at https://www.python.org/ for your operating system

this codebase uses no external libraries

## Usage Guidelines

### Direct usage guidelines

**for testing**, I would highly recommend the use of the ".testmode" file, this is present by default, deleting it would enable the app in production mode, but the .testmode file ensure that the user enters the current date everytime they use the application

1. Usage of the app is extremely simple, and it can directly be used via calling `python main.py`
2. Since the app has no external dependencies, no pip installation is required (only python libraries are used here!)

### Usage Examples can be found in /examples, 5 usage examples are given below

- [weekly task 1, Cooking an Amazing meal for myself every week](/examples/cook-an-amazing-meal.md)
- [weekly task 2, Watering the cactus](/examples/watering-the-cactus.md)
- [daily task 1, Meditation](/examples/meditation.md)
- [daily task 2, Brushing my teeth](/examples/brushing-teeth.md)
- [daily task 3, Going for a morning walk](/examples/going-for-a-morning-walk.md)

## Development or Testing guidelines

- The project currently uses the [numpydoc](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) documentation style
- This project uses [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) for testing, and requires no additional libraries
    + testing can simply be done using ` python -m unittest discover .\tests\ "test_*.py"`
